        <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          At Locus, we are firmly committed to protecting all users, especially
          children, from any form of harm, exploitation, or abuse. We strictly
          prohibit content that involves child sexual abuse or exploitation
          (CSAE).
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Zero Tolerance for CSAE</h2>
        <p>
          We do not allow any content, media, or interaction that depicts or
          promotes child sexual abuse or exploitation. Accounts involved in such
          activity will be banned, and the content will be reported to relevant
          authorities.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Reporting Abuse</h2>
        <p>
          Users can report inappropriate or harmful behavior directly through
          our in-app report feature. Reports are collected securely through a
          Google Form and reviewed by our moderation team.
